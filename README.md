# Cancer diagnosis
### Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set <br>
In this personal project, the main purpose is classifying benign or malignant of breast tissues 
### Brief overview: 
1. Data preprocessing and data visualization
2. Linear regression  
3. Classification by using K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
4. Model Evaluation 

All of the steps of brief overview are done on <a href="https://github.com/vy-phung/Cancer-diagnosis/blob/master/Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin_(Diagnostic)_Data_Set.ipynb">Google Colab</a> <br>
I also create a website for interactive visualization <a href="https://cancer-plotly.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
